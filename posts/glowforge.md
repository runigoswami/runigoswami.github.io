#####Design Challenge: Laser-made Product Example Quick Design

First, both steps of this project are purposefully vague-- you job isn't to hole up and do the thing, your job is to work with me to produce an awesome outcome (which is sometimes different than "making me a happy customer" - if you think I’m wrong about something, tell me!).  So I expect both phases will start with quick questions/conversation.  

Okay, to the project.  The goal is to spend no more than 10 hours in total and get as far as we can. You can grab me whenever.  My calendar is here:
https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=tony%40glowforge.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles
(in case you're wondering where the heck I am if I'm not around)

Goal: We've got a gallery of laser-made examples on the home page.  We need to expand that and start building the foundation for our catalog.  Anything we create that's awesome, we might add that gallery, share on social channels, or add to our display table at the office.  

Phase 1: Make a list of at least 5 projects that we should do with a short description of what the project is and why it's a good idea.  If it's inspired by something you've found on Pinterest or elsewhere, include a link.  Example: "We should make a stacked plywood bathymetric map with a wood frame like this one, but maybe with a more modern aesthetic.  The water layers should be stained blue (maybe with some deeper colors for lower layers?) with the land kept natural.  This is great because it's an obvious personalization opportunity ("you could do your own town/block!") and it uses cheap materials.  There are other reasons this would be great, including..."

Phase 2: I'll pick a project.  It might be from your list or it might not.  The desired outcome here is to have an AI file (or series of AI files) that is laser-ready with concise assembly/finishing instructions.

Here are some initial ideas I have for possible projects:

1. Paper, card stock, or acrylic layered lightbox inspired by the artwork of Hari & Deepti : http://www.blackbookgallery.com/artists/hari-deepti/

2. Some sort of simple automata/ kinetic sculpture — requires more precision, inspired by these amazing creations http://www.thisiscolossal.com/tags/kinetic-sculpture/ but will probably be more akin to these http://www.mechanical-toys.com/book2.htm, somewhat in-between level: https://grabcad.com/library/wooden-snake-automata

3. Geometric jewelry -- I don't actually know how possible any of these kinds of math-inspired works are to make but I'll throw them in here: https://www.shapeways.com/shops/bathsheba

4. Functional wind chimes or some other type of hanging wind-powered mobile: https://www.etsy.com/listing/51156903/wind-sculpture-kinetic-rusted-metal?ref=market like this but not

5. Wooden puzzle animals like these https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d8/93/79/d8937989bfeac5d1d10df960d7096222.jpg

6. Ambitious acrylic sculptures inspired by waves akin to these lovely pieces by Ben Young http://brokenliquid.com/
