# Berry Library Exhibit

####Fall 2014 — Winter 2015

#####Project Overview
The main concourse in Dartmouth's Baker-Berry Library features a rotating exhibition of student work, rare texts, and departmental research. The library staff approached the [Neukom Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation (DALI) Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu "DALI Home") in Fall 2014 and asked the lab to put together a showcase of lab projects completed in the lab's first year. The lab has "digital" in the name so as you can imagine, the vast majority of the work produced by the lab is not conducive to be displayed in static, physical, display cases.

The concourse in question is the most central corridor of the most central building on campus. It's generally unavoidable by even the most reclusive students, particularly during the winter months when so-called "warm cuts" through the library are crucial. As lead designer, I wanted to introduce the campus to some of the work we do in the lab without simply printing out screenshots of websites and mobile apps. I wanted to create an engaging exhibit which would brighten up the generally gray space and create discussion around the lab. Not only was this my first time designing for a physical exhibit, it was my first time working at a such a large scale.

This is the first floor of Berry Library:

######Berry Library First Floor Plan

The main concourse lies to the right of the section labeled "9", directly in front of the stairway. It comprises:
* four large display cases (measuring 74"x96" each — for scale, five Runi-sized humans could comfortably fit inside one case)
* five 36" diameter pillars
* one 40 ft. long brick wall

I had one month to design the exhibit, two weeks to install the physical exhibit, another two weeks to design and organize a launch event for 200 guests, all for a budget of $3000. Along the way I learned that:
* t-pins and foamcore are invaluable
* inexpensive jersey fabric is a quick and easy way to make backdrops for large spaces
* you can safely laser etch 24"x36" mirrors
* you can hang said mirrors from a thin cord in a crowded hallway for three months with 0 years of bad luck
* fluorescent hallway lighting is not conducive to any sort of projection
* everything can be reused once the exhibit ends

#####Content Details

I created a lot of posters and related graphics for this exhibit. I used the lab space as inspiration and used the lab colors of blue and orange liberally throughout.  Looking back, I would have designed some of the posters differently. However, because of the sheer magnitude of this project and the number of assets I created for it, I think I improved tremendously as a designer as a result of creating this exhibit. Here are some images I printed and backed with foamcore for display in the cases.
