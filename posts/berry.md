# Berry Library Exhibit

The main concourse in Dartmouth's Baker-Berry Library features a rotating exhibition of student work, rare texts, and departmental research. The library staff approached the Neukom Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation (DALI) Lab in Fall 2014 and asked the lab to put together a showcase of lab projects completed in the lab's first year.
