# Sharon & Ambrose's Wedding Designs

####Fall 2014

#####Project Overview
My one and only sister and (now) brother-in-law got married on October 12, 2014! I admittedly didn't do very much (read: any) to help them with planning. Terrible sister that I am, I didn't even make their wedding website! However, one week before the wedding, it turned out that there were no place cards, cocktail menus, or instructions for the polaroid guestbook at the reception. I was home and armed with Illustrator so I took the colors from their main menus and went to work.


My only contribution to the wedding which was not last minute was my sister's wedding present. I wanted to make something special that she couldn't get anywhere else or from anyone else so I designed a 3D printed necklace (printed in brass and gold plated by Shapeways). The script reads "Didi" or older sister in Bengali and the body is of a cheetah, her favorite animal.

######Wedding Present
I didn't have the foresight to find a suitable chain for it but it turned out for the best because she found the perfect cord while on her honeymoon in Argentina.

#####Wedding Speech
As a bonus for anyone who was at the wedding, here's a copy of the (in)famous speech I gave:

Cuando eramos ninas - NOT cuando habiamos hermanas pequenas - mi hermana y yo siempre juguemos juntos. She asked me to help brush up her Castellano before they head off to Argentina. But we haven’t really had many chances to focus on Spanish lessons in the past, week, month, year, how long have you two been engaged again? Somehow I think she’d be fine even if she didn’t remember a lick of Spanish. This was the girl who was so friendly even as a toddler that she’d pick up strangers off the sidewalk and invite them to our home. Remember, this was in the 90s so no one found this strange. This was the girl who’d babble for hours with the telephone operator and leave the phone off the hook. But all that was before I showed up to the scene.

As Ambrose has undoubtedly realized by now — what Didi wants, Didi tends to get. And what Didi really wanted at the ripe old age of 3 was a playmate to replace the unsatisfactory operators. More specifically, she wanted a little sister named Lassie after her favorite show at the time. What she got was exactly that minus the moniker.

As kids we’d go everywhere and do everything together. We’d read the same books — the entire Enid Blyton corpus mainly — and we’d create elaborate worlds that only we would understand. What would end up happening is I’d play the main character and Didi would play all the other ones even if it meant multiple costume changes and continuous accent switches. It worked out well in Bluebell Wood, Gyp land, The Demelza Robbins story, and even our most recent play, Fabulous! A Musical.

So in that vein, allow me to present a short dramatic rendition of choice excerpts from a gchat conversation that occurred between the two of us 8 years ago on May 8, 2006 at 10:04 pm.

Hi didi

Hi. Did you see my lawn party pictures?

Nope, did you send them to me? Or are they on facebook?

They are on facebook.

Okay, hold on. Oooo pretty. Should I put them in a MS Word doc like I did with the tea party pics so that Ma can see them?

If you want. The boy I like is in one picture. You should guess who it is.

Aww, there’s too many to guess

Well, guess anyway, it’s more fun that way

Hmmm...Ambrose?

Good job :)

I thought so, the others don’t seem your type. Plus you’ve only talked of Ambrose before out of those depicted.

What is “my type”?

I don’t know. I can just tell when you might like someone based on looks and facial expressions. Plus you sort of gave it away last time when you compared Ambrose to Ian.

Ambrose is much better than Ian. Smarter too.

Yeah, I know, he goes to Princeton.

Well, he’s in crew so he’s not supposed to be smart

Yeah, whatever, he got into Princeton and hasn’t dropped out yet.

How do you think he looks?

Some pics look better than others, but on the whole, the verdict is he is a dapper chap.

For the record, Ambrose, I think that assessment from 8 years ago still holds. You’re still a dapper chap.
