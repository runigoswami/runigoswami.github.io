**ABSTRACT**

Attention is a limited resource that intrinsically dictates our perceptions, memories, and
behaviors. Further, visuospatial attention correlates highly with user engagement, heart
rate, and arousal [El-Nasr et al., 2010]. Artists and interactive game designers strive to
capture and direct attention, yet even in the most carefully crafted graphic narratives viewer
eye paths – a proxy for attention – vary up to 20 percent [McCloud, 1994; Jain et al., 2012a].
Our aim is to use attentional measures to enrich graphic novel narratives. FrameShift uses
eye tracking to measure reader attention and changes text and visual elements later on in the
story accordingly. We have built an extensible framework for using attention to introduce
perceptual changes in narratives. We use attention as an indirect method for interactions
and introduce shiftable frame nodes that change readers’ belief states over time.
