##Shift Your Attention, Shift the Story

###Master's Thesis Project

I created a novel framework for graphic storytelling which uses reader attention, as measured by eye gaze fixation, to introduce subtle narrative and graphic changes and in turn change readers’ belief states over time. In real life, we miss conspicuous objects, people, and events that take place before our very eyes, a phenomenon called inattentional blindness. In our crowded visual worlds, we can't attend to everything and saliency maps in our brains weigh top-down and bottom-up factors to determine what we spend our limited attention on. While reading, on the other hand, there are no consequences for not attending to something.
If we miss something, we can always go back and reread the passage. So I, along with my collaborator, Tim Tregubov, built a framework in Unity for a new shifting narrative experience, where your attention matters and changes your perception of the characters and course of events, just like it does in real life.
We presented our work as both a talk and a poster in August at the 42nd International Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (ACM SIGGRAPH 2015) and I'm currently authoring and illustrating a full length graphic novel with this framework.

I couldn't have asked for a better first SIGGRAPH experience. So grateful to everyone who came to watch and asked questions afterward.

**ABSTRACT**

Attention is a limited resource that intrinsically dictates our perceptions, memories, and behaviors. Further, visuospatial attention correlates highly with user engagement, heart rate, and arousal [El-Nasr et al., 2010]. Artists and interactive game designers strive to capture and direct attention, yet even in the most carefully crafted graphic narratives viewer eye paths – a proxy for attention – vary up to 20 percent [McCloud, 1994; Jain et al., 2012a]. Our aim is to use attentional measures to enrich graphic novel narratives. FrameShift uses eye tracking to measure reader attention and changes text and visual elements later on in the story accordingly. We have built an extensible framework for using attention to introduce perceptual changes in narratives. We use attention as an indirect method for interactions and introduce shiftable frame nodes that change readers’ belief states over time.
