# &iexcl;Perú!

##August 21 — September 4

I motioned to the ladies in the Hotel Colón salon that I wanted them to lop off over a foot of my hair. I was in 7th grade, wore a braid that extended to my thighs, hadn't taken my first Spanish class yet, and it was my first time in South America. Specifically: Ecuador. The only thing I was confident about at that moment was the fact that I needed to stop spending hours brushing, detangling, and crying over knots in my hair. I knew that with the language barrier, this was my chance. The ladies reluctantly lightened my head and mourned the loss of my beautiful tresses Ma worked so hard to maintain. Ma was appalled but I felt transformed — a transformation that has lasted through the entire zodiac that has passed since our last trip to South America. Many things have changed since, but my hair has permanently stayed shorter than the small of my back. What follows are assorted photos and anecdotes (some more about hair) from Ma & my adventures in Perú over the past two weeks. We'll see what sticks around for the next twelve years.

While in Perú, we mainly encountered these package tourists in airport gates and hotel lobbies. They were easy to spot because they traveled in herds with matching bright lanyards lest they stray too far from the pack. They always seemed to be having a great time but never really seemed to be quite sure where they were supposed to be. Once, while boarding our flight to Puno, a lady had misplaced her husband who had "gone to find out what gate we were at"


If you are even a little bit concerned about your budget while traveling: avoid the all-inclusive package like the plague. Even if you
