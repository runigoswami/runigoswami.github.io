# &iexcl;Perú!

##August 21 — September 4

###Background
I motioned to the ladies in the Hotel Colón salon that I wanted them to lop off over a foot of my hair. I was in 7th grade, wore a braid that extended to my thighs, hadn't taken my first Spanish class yet, and it was my first time in South America. Specifically: Ecuador. The only thing I was confident about at that moment was the fact that I needed to stop spending hours brushing, detangling, and crying over knots in my hair. I knew that with the language barrier, this was my chance. The ladies reluctantly lightened my head and mourned the loss of my beautiful tresses Ma worked so hard to maintain. Ma was appalled but I felt transformed — a transformation that has lasted through the entire zodiac that has passed since our last trip to South America. Many things have changed since, but my hair has permanently stayed shorter than the small of my back. What follows are assorted photos and anecdotes (some more about hair) from Ma & my adventures in Perú over the past two weeks. We'll see what sticks around for the next twelve years.

#####Spoiler alerts: I didn't change my hair there & this is going to be a really long post

###Planning
Thanks to the draw of Machu Picchu and really effective marketing from the [Peruvian tourism board](http://www.peru.travel/en-us/), there is no scarcity of information about *Your trip to Perú!* online. There are a seemingly infinite number of package tours (*for every type of traveler!*) which take care of every aspect of *Your trip to Perú!* and prevent you from worrying (or thinking) about anything until they hand you an invoice for $10,000 a piece — not including airfare and some lodging.

While in Perú, we mainly encountered these package tourists in airport gates and hotel lobbies. They were easy to spot because they traveled in herds with matching red lanyards lest they stray too far from the pack. They always seemed to be having a great time but never really seemed to know where they were. Once, while boarding our flight to Puno, a lady had misplaced her husband who had "gone to find out what gate we were at" never mind the fact that the gate number was literally printed on the lanyards. The tour operators handled all of their boarding passes and hotel registrations which was nice but I'm not sure that's worth the $5,000 extra.

If you are even a little bit concerned about your budget while traveling: avoid the all-inclusive package like the plague. A much cheaper, and more flexible solution, is a few smaller day trip tours (which can be easily arranged while you're in Peru) to Lake Titicaca, Colca Canyon, and the like. Also much cheaper? Buying internal flights from the Spanish language versions of the sites instead of the English ones! I looked up the *exact same itinerary* on the [English](http://www.lan.com/en_us/sitio_personas/index.html) and [Spanish](http://www.lan.com/es_pe/sitio_personas/index.html) sites and saved over $700 by using the latter. A few sites cautioned we might encounter

There were no fees, fines, or taxes
