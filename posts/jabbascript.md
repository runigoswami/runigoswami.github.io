#####Project Overview

Dartmouth's CS department is about to offer a brand new course in web development (CS66 offered 17W). I've recently created some new characters that might just help the next crop of budding web developers. Stay tuned for the full cast of characters!

Jabba the Script is the character that started it all from a pun that may have gone a bit too far. Just like his Hutt inspiration, JabbaScript is a gangster and arbiter who won't accept buggy code from his web dev bounty hunters.
