#Draper iOS App

####One hour in Spring 2015

A few months ago, one of my friends [Matt Ritter](http://mattritter.me) wanted to make a simple-stupid app to commemorate the end of AMC's Mad Men. He was very passionate about it and you can read his post about it [here](http://www.mattritter.me/?p=63). He needed some designs (and a name for the app) so I took it as a quick design warmup challenge. I spent approximately one hour making the following mockups and icon designs but I think they turned out quite nicely, considering:

If you're interested in the app, you can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/ritmatter/Draper). I didn't contribute to this at all development wise.
