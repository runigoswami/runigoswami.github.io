# DALI Lab Metrics

####Spring 2015

#####Project Overview
The [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu "DALI Home") turned two this April! What started as a small experiment with 15 students has grown to a fledgling startup-like lab with an average of 60 students per term and a competitive application process.  The rapid growth and progress is very exciting but also challenging to explain to potential donors and students. We found that similar questions popped up every time we presented the lab to new people, specifically:
* What do you make?
* How is the lab structured?
* How do new projects enter the lab and how many do you work on?
* Are you a fee-for-service? Do you make a profit?
* How do you pay student employees?
* Do you have to know programming to work in the lab?
* etc.

As a Neuroscience major, I spent much of my undergraduate life in scietific research labs. I'm a firm believer in hard data and I think there's beauty in making sense of numbers. I was frustrated with the guesstimated numbers and fuzzy math we would often use to answer these common questions so I decided to use the data we already collected from our projects, partners, and members and communicate it clearly through visualizations. Informally, I've found that providing visitors these introductory graphics ahead of time, leads to deeper questions during their visits.

#####Visualizations
The number one visitors ask is "What is the DALI Lab." The short answer is that the Digital Arts Leadership & Innovation Lab is a startup-like space in the Dartmouth Computer Science Department where students build and learn cool things together. This answer leads to a lot more questions â€” what students? what do you build? do students receive course credit for their work? are students paid? and so on. I think much of the confusion comes from the word "lab" in the name. Lab is a very context-dependent word. Because the DALI Lab lives in an academic setting, often the prior expectation is that the lab is a traditional research lab with a few graduate students, post-docs, and undergraduates working on similar research problems under the advisement of a principle investigator. In fact, the DALI Lab is more of a holacracy with ~25 different concurrent project teams of 3 - 5 designers and developers. This is how the lab works:

The next big question is "What kind of things does the lab do/make?" Here's the overall breakdown:

Shown differently, those percentages comprise:

One of the most unique aspects of the lab is the gender breakdown in comparison to the rest of the tech industry. A full 50% of DALI members are women. In contrast, 30% of the Dartmouth Computer Science and 18% of the Computer Science majors in the US are women. Tellingly, 5/7 of the lab's current staff members are women. Here's how the Lab compares to Google gender-wise:

Another surprising aspect of the Lab is the diversity of student majors and class years. This is a metric that's perhaps more relevant for Dartmouth students interested in applying to the lab. In a broader context, this data illustrates the fact that a baseline level of technological knowledge is increasingly relevant in every field and that programming is an increasingly accessible tool. I think the students' broad liberal arts backgrounds helps the Lab approach problem solving more creatively.

Over the past two years, I've had the pleasure of watching the Lab grow and develop an open, collaborative, culture. I'm sad to move on from both the Lab and from Dartmouth but I'm excited to see how the Lab continues to grow in the years to come.

#####Interactivity Sandbox
I'm working on turning these static visualizations for presentations into interactive visualizations for the DALI Lab's eventual website revamp. Stay tuned!
