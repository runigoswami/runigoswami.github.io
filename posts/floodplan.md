#Dartmouth DC Flood Plan

####Winter 2014 - Spring 2014

#####Project Overview

Constitution Avenue in Washington D.C. was the former site of Goose Creek. The creek was later channeled into L'Enfant's Canal and filled in the 1860s. Even later fill closer to the Potomac River caused Constitution Avenue to be the lowest area in the Federal Triangle. In 2006, a historic flood event in the nation's capital flooded many buildings in the federal triangle, including the National Archives, and caused quite a bit of damage.

Karol Kawiaka, an architecture professor in Dartmouth's Studio Art Department created a long term landscaping proposal for Washington D.C.'s federal triangle area to prevent future floods and asked the DALI Lab to help present her work to policy makers in Washington.

######GIFs of Proposed Solution

Professor Kawiaka's proposed solution would:
* Restore	the	path	of	Goose	Creek	and	L’Enfant’s	Canal
* Restore	drainage	for	the	low	area	in	the	Federal	Triangle-Constitution	Avenue
* Provide	a	Retention	Area	near	the	Washington	Monument	on	the	original	site	of L’Enfant’s	Canal	with	enough	holding	capacity	to	drain	the Federal	Triangle	area (in	non-flooding	conditions	this	Washington	Monument	Retention	Area	would	act	as a flat	gathering	place	for	events	and/or	playing	fields	for sports)
* Provide	an	outlet	to	the	Tidal	Basin	for	the	water	from	this	Retention	Area	along 17th	Street	thus	restoring	an	outlet	for	the	water	draining	from	the	Federal Triangle (swale	sizing along	Constitution	Avenue	and	for	the	Washington	Monument	Retention Area	is	based	on	the	Flow	Calculations	for	the	Federal Triangle	Flooding	Event	in 2006)

I went through Karol's (extensive) research into this problem and created a storyboard to convey the information as succinctly as possible.
