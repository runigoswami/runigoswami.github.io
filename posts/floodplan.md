#Dartmouth DC Flood Plan

####Winter 2014 - Spring 2014

#####Project Overview

Constitution Avenue in Washington D.C. was the former site of Goose Creek. The creek was later channeled into L'Enfant's Canal and filled in the 1860s. Even later fill closer to the Potomac River has led Consitution Avenue to be the lowest area in the Federal Triangle. In 2006, a historic flood event in the nation's capital flooded many buildings in the federal triangle, including the National Archives, and caused quite a bit of damage. Karol Kawiaka, an architecture professor in Dartmouth's Studio Art Department created a long term landscaping proposal for Washington D.C.'s federal triangle area to prevent future floods and asked the DALI Lab to help present her work to policy makers in Washington.
