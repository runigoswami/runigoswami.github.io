####Selfie Llama

Our second stop, Cusco, gave us our first taste of the famous Andean altitude. Altitude sickness, or *soroche* as the cuzqueños call it, is both difficult to predict and difficult to diagnose. It's also difficult to avoid mention of in whatever guidebook or post you read about visiting Cusco. Unsurprising considering Perú's historic capital is located a staggering 11,200 ft (3,400 m) above sea level. Even more inescapable are the ads for the "Sorojchi Pill" Ma & I fortunately avoided soroche while in the highlands but we were met with ads like these:

right from when we disembarked. The ad above is a bit misleading when you consider Machu Picchu is 7,900 ft above sea level. No one has altitude sickness anywhere near Machu Picchu, but we'll get there later. In addition to questionable Sorrojchi Pill ads, the Cusco airport is also home to some pretty amazing LG charging kiosks which invite you take "Selfie Llamas." I'm still not entirely sure what Selfie Llamas are but the kiosk successfully convinced me to interact with it. And why wouldn't I? It's a large touchscreen
