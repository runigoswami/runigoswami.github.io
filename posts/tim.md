#Personal Branding • Tim Tregubov

####Spring 2015 — Summer 2015

#####Project Overview

One of my best friends and thesis partner-in-crime [Tim Tregubov](http://zingweb.com) requested that I make him a personal logo and mascot. He wanted a playful, simple, and versatile logo that incorporated some sort of animal. Here were some logos and characters he sent for inspiration:

I started off by making an inspiration board and some sketches

Cleaned up the design and here's the final logo, I think he looks pretty adorable either way!

#####Business Cards
The versatile logo works well on these foldable business cards I made as well. Tim and I landed upon the laptop business card idea as a clever way to get all of his information across. He's an Apple enthusiast so there's a lot of not-so-subtle nods to the MacBook Pro.

I think they turned out pretty great!
