# Dartmouth Visual Computing Lab
# Branding and Website

####Spring 2015

#####Project Overview

New professors in the Computer Science Department, Emily Whiting and Wojciech Jarosz, asked the [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu "DALI Home") to provide a digital home for their new [Visual Computing Lab](http://vcl.cs.dartmouth.edu "VCL Home"). They wanted a responsive site that would be easy to update, highlight recent publications, attract future graduate students, and most importantly â€” stand out from other sites in the small graphics community. They also needed a two-week turn-around time from the initial ask date to accommodate the looming graduate studies deadlines.

Typically, the DALI Lab project timeline mirrors that of the Dartmouth quarter system and doesn't accept new projects that come in the middle of term. So Tim Tregubov, the technical director of the lab, and I decided that we'd take this project on ourselves as a design challenge, as a potential model for future DALI projects, and as a nice distraction from our Master's theses!

#####Design Iterations

A blank slate can be both a blessing and a curse. To start us off Professors Whiting and Jarosz provided links to other Computer Graphics labs (you can visit them [here](https://graphics.ethz.ch/), [here](http://graphics.berkeley.edu/), [here](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/), and [here](http://web.mit.edu/structuraldesign/about.html)). I wanted to create a space that felt less traditionally academic than most of these sites and turned toward design schools and dribbble for inspiration instead. I also wanted to fundamentally integrate Professor Whiting's 3D fabrication work into the design and drew the color palette from some of her pieces.

######Inspiration board for VCL Branding

For the logo I strove to create a simple design that drew inspiration from the principles of Computer Graphics, namely the triangle, circle, and square primitive shapes. In my early sketches I kept coming back to designs comprising these simple shapes. Sometimes the first idea is best.

######Initial Thumbnail Sketches

After a lot of back and forth with the professors, I finally landed on a modern logo with nods to the primitive shapes and with a subtle eye shape to tie-in the "Visual" of VCL.

######Final Logo

The rest of the website design fell into place fairly quickly because we decided to use an off-the-shelf Squarespace template given the time crunch. We used a little bit of custom css and javascript to place low poly overlays on the image headers and to replace the landing image with random videos of the professors' works.

#####Takeaways
The site's been up for four months and we haven't had any complaints from the professors. While a two-week timeframe leaves no time for multiple iterations and robust testing, it also leaves no time for drawn-out weak design decisions or procrastination. I often get bogged down in the details before moving on to the next large component. Working on a limited timeline was a good way for me to see the big picture, create a minimum viable product, and stand by my design decisions.
