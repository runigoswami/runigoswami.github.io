#DALI Icons & Postcard

####Summer 2014 - Fall 2014

To recruit new members to the [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu) in the fall, I decided to make DALI postcards to put in the mailboxes of all incoming freshmen. Around the same time, the rest of the Lab staff and I formalized a lot of processes we had developed in the first year of DALI. We'd already thought of "the 3 Ds of DALI" as Design, Develop, Deliver, but we didn't have a lot of visual language to accompany our process. I made some icons to change that fact and to put on the postcards.

Through these postcards I was introduced to the marvelous world of bleeds and color profiles and learned that print design is an entirely different beast from digital media design. In the fall we had ~150 new people apply to work in the lab so I consider this project a great success.
