###Lima: Part 1

Mr. Kelly's 10th grade World History class took place in a small temporary trailer at the back of my high school near the tennis court. For a class titled **World** History, we spent a disproportionately long time studying Francisco Pizarro's conquest of the Inca and all things Perú. We also spent a great deal of time discussing how Mr. Kelly's girlfriend at the time was an *egyptologist* instead of a *pyramidologist* and how this was a major point of contention in their relationship. We were split into groups of four and assigned an aspect of Peruvian culture and/or history to research and present. Here's my team's, frankly horrible, [powerpoint](/img/peru/peru-project.pdf). I was responsible for the "Evolution of Food" section and I only vaguely remember presenting it. What I *do* remember is that we brought in Inca Cola and potato chips for the occasion — with mixed reactions from the class. Mr. Kelly would often announce authoritatively that "Lima is one of the up-and-coming gastronomic capitals of the world!" Unfortunately, our chosen refreshments were not illustrative of this fact. Inca Cola, to non-Peruvian palates, is a shockingly yellow and shockingly unpleasant, carbonated bubble gum beverage that I did not drink in Perú. Instead, I became a loyal devotee of the church of Chicha Morada from day one:

Ma and I spent our first day in Perú at the Museo Larco: the #1 attraction on TripAdvisor for Lima, absolutely beautiful, and close to absolutely nothing else in the city. The thing about Lima that none of the travel books told us is that you need to spend a *minimum* of 30 minutes in a taxi to get basically anywhere. If you stay in Miraflores, the swanky, upscale, beachside, part of the city where most of the big hotels are, you will face the following travel times & taxi fares:
* 60 minutes to get to/from the airport (55-95 soles)
* 40+ minutes to get to the Museo Larco (35-45 soles)
* 30 minutes to the Plaza de Armas (25-45 soles)
* 20 minutes to get to the Parque de la Reserva (15-45 soles)
* 10-15 minutes to get to the Larcomar shopping center (5-20 soles)

Nowhere in Perú do taxi fares vary as much as they do in Lima.
